This is awesome

## Text and Images

Oslo is a city rounded and integrated with nature, it is like a city that grew inside an co-exist with a forest. I have jogged around 9km from my house until find myself in front of a lake and forest, it's amazing.

The city in architectural terms (hipster tavo will laugh) is full of really nice buildings, the sensation I get is that they represent very well the Norwegian culture of "doing the things well once", even the old buildings are all very well maintained.

I have walked a lot in Oslo and many times I find myself wondered with things inside the city, like *Frognerparken*.

## Code

```ruby
describe ThirdPartyWrapper
  describe '#fetch_users' do
    it "returns the list of users from the 3rd party service" do
      VCR.use_cassette("custom_cassette_name") do
        # ... code testing the service ...
      end
    end
  end
end
```
